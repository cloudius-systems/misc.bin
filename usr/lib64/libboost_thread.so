/* GNU ld script

   Boost.Thread header files pull in enough of Boost.System that
   symbols from the latter library are referenced by a compiled object
   that includes Boost.Thread headers.  libboost_system-mt.so is among
   libboost_thread-mt.so's DT_NEEDED, but program linker requires that
   missing symbols are satisfied by direct dependency, not by a
   transitive one.  Hence this linker script, which brings in the
   Boost.System DSO.  */
